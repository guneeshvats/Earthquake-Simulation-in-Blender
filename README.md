# Simulating-Earthquake-Exploring-Building-Vulnerabilities-using-Blender
Earthquake Simulation using `Blender`. This repo is a project for the course - Disaster Management - spring '24. We have taken various cases of multi-storey buildings and simulated a real world scenario with tuning the hyper-parameters on blender and constructing various typologies and structure of buildings to see what is the impact of a the earthquake with different magnitudes.

This project was created in `Blender 3d 2.79`

## Variations involved in the structures : 
1. Column Density
2. Floor Plan
3. Height Design
4. Material
