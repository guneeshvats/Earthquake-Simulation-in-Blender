# Simulating-Earthquake-Exploring-Building-Vulnerabilities-using-Blender
Earthquake Simulation using `Blender 3D 2.79`

This repository is final project for the course - Disaster Management - spring '24 @IIIT Hyderabad.
We have taken various cases of multi-storey buildings and simulated a real world scenario with tuning the hyper-parameters on blender and constructing various typologies and structure of buildings to see what is the impact of earthquake with different magnitudes.

This project was created in `Blender 3d 2.79`

## Variations involved in the structures : 
1. Column Density
2. Floor Plan
3. Height Design
4. Material 

You can run these belnder files only in the Blender 2.79 version. 

## Constants 

1. Standard column dimensions :  `1 x 1 x 4`
2. standard ceiling dimensions : `H x W (as required)` : `Thickness 0.5`
